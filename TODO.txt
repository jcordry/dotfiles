Bugs:

- mksyslink does not take into account the files for man - Only badly
- There is no distinction between the accounts in mutt

To be added:

- Look at:
  - Completion
  - Bash functions
- Add:
  - zsh
  - w3m
- Mod
  - tmux
  - inputrc
  - gconf? <- problems with portability

Trouble:

- What is wrong with cygwin? Why so slow?
