# My Dotfiles

This is an attempt at creating a repository for my dotfiles. I intend to use it
to store and maintain my vimrc, vim (pluggins), bashrc, profile, bash_aliases,
bash_functions and perhaps a few others at a later stage (emacs, zsh, tmux,
mutt, input).

To install:

        $ git clone https://github.com/jcordry/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
        $ cd ~/dotfiles
        $ git submodule init && git submodule update
        $ ./mksyslink.sh
